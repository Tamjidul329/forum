                    Lately there have been a lot of beached sperm whales washing up on the Far Rockaway shoreline.
                    Beach goers noticed something off last Saturday night, when they saw the silhouette of an obese
                    woman
                    approxiamly 800 feet from the shore. Shortly after seeing it, a huge wave, almost like a tsunami,
                    pushed itself onto the shoreline,
                    taking 87 victims with it into the ocean. Of the 87, only 7 survived, along with professional
                    olympic swimmer, Michael Phelps.
                    Upon going back to the ocean, the waves left behind 8 sperm whales on the beach, gasping for air. It
                    has been \
                    a few days now, and the smell of dead fish, similar to that of the trap queens in Miami, flooded the
                    air. Locals are beginning to complain
                    saying that the smell is forcing them to relocate form the area.

                    We looked over the security footage, and it appears the shadowy figure seen was in fact, your
                    mother.
